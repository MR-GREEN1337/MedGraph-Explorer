MedGraph Insights is a cutting-edge agentic application that transforms medical diagnosis by combining the power of ArangoDB GraphRAG and NVIDIA GPU acceleration to identify patterns invisible to traditional analysis methods.

Our system reimagines how medical professionals can interact with complex healthcare data by enabling natural language queries across patient records, symptoms, and conditions. What sets MedGraph Insights apart is its innovative hybrid query execution system that dynamically determines whether to use AQL, NetworkX/cuGraph algorithms, or a combination of both based on query complexity.

### Key Innovations:

1. **Intelligent Query Classification**: The agent automatically analyzes query intent and selects the optimal processing method (Simple/Complex/Hybrid), making sophisticated graph analytics accessible to non-technical users.

2. **GPU-Accelerated Pattern Detection**: Leverages NVIDIA cuGraph to identify complex relationships and patterns in medical data that would be computationally prohibitive with traditional methods.

3. **Rare Disease Focus**: Specifically optimized to detect anomalous patterns and unusual symptom combinations that may indicate rare conditions, helping reduce the "diagnostic odyssey" patients often face.

4. **Multi-modal Analysis Tools**: Includes specialized tools for patient symptom analysis, evidence path visualization, and similar case detection - all through a simple conversational interface.

5. **Dynamic Visualization**: Automatically generates appropriate visualizations (networks, timelines, heatmaps) based on query context, making complex medical relationships immediately understandable.

### Real-World Impact:

In healthcare, rare diseases often go undiagnosed for years because their patterns are too complex to detect with traditional methods. MedGraph Insights transforms this paradigm by enabling medical professionals to explore relationships across patient populations, symptoms, and conditions in ways previously impossible.

By demonstrating how the combination of graph databases, LLMs, and GPU acceleration can revolutionize medical diagnosis, MedGraph Insights showcases the future of healthcare informatics - where complex patterns are instantly discoverable and rare conditions are identified earlier, potentially saving years of suffering for patients.

### Technical Implementation:

Built on ArangoDB for graph storage, our solution implements a React agent powered by LangGraph with specialized tools for medical graph analysis. The dynamic hybrid execution approach leverages both AQL for relationship queries and NetworkX/cuGraph for complex pattern analysis, with GPU acceleration providing the computational power needed for advanced algorithms.

This project demonstrates how GraphRAG represents a fundamental leap beyond vector-based RAG systems, addressing hallucinations and enabling structured reasoning across complex knowledge graphs.
